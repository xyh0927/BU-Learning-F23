Based on the output results for Task 4, the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm can be observed to be varying across different clusters. Some clusters show a strong prevalence of documents from a specific category, indicating effective clustering. For instance, Cluster 10 is heavily dominated by the "sci" category, constituting 82.06% of the documents, and Cluster 17 is overwhelmingly comprised of the "comp" category, making up 94.50% of the total.
However, several clusters reflect a mix of categories, albeit with one category still being predominant. This indicates that while the algorithm is effective in clustering similar documents together, it is not perfect and has room for improvement in terms of the purity of the clusters.
Furthermore, some clusters, like Cluster 16 and Cluster 11, exhibit a more even distribution among the top categories, suggesting that these clusters may be less coherent in terms of the topics they represent.
In conclusion, the clustering algorithm has demonstrated a considerable level of effectiveness, as evidenced by the dominant categories in most clusters. However, the presence of mixed categories within these clusters points towards potential enhancements that could be made to improve the algorithm's accuracy and the purity of the clusters. Adjustments in features selection, algorithm parameters, or even exploring advanced clustering techniques could potentially lead to more distinct and homogeneous clusters.
