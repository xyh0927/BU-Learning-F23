1.Create a view named additional_person_info
This view should give the names of states, employment categories, and education levels along with all the other fields in the person_economic_info table for use in later reports.  
Hint: you don’t need to specify each field individually for the person_economic_info table, think about how to select all the columns from the table.  Once you have your query constructed, turn it into a view.
